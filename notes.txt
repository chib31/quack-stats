1) Raw Data

2) Refined Data (computed)
	- select filters applied
	- grouping applied

3) Table Data (data - copies )
	- range filters applied
	- sorting applied


Select filter options and model are on the raw data.
Grouping options + model are on the raw data.

I can't use a computed value for Table Data because I need to saved data on it that doesn't apply to the raw data

So - I need a watcher which detects whenever Refined Data changes, then:
	- copies Refined Data to Table Data
	- calculates maxRangeLimit and minRangeLimit values for all range filter columns, and add these values to the column on Refined Data
	- applies sorting to
